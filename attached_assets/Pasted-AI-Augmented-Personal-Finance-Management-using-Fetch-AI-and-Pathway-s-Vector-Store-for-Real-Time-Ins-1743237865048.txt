AI-Augmented Personal Finance Management using Fetch AI and Pathway’s Vector Store for Real-Time Insights

Background & Motivation:
Personal finance management has evolved beyond static budget tracking to real-time financial intelligence. With transaction data continuously streaming from various sources, individuals require AI-driven insights to make informed financial decisions. By leveraging AI agents for intelligent analysis and vector-based real-time transaction processing, this project aims to optimize personal finance management using quantitative finance principles.

Objective:
To develop a Quant-AI hybrid finance management system that:

Ingests and processes real-time transaction data using Pathway’s vector store.

Employs Fetch AI’s AI agents to analyze transactions, categorize spending, and predict financial trends.

Handles natural language financial queries, such as "Can I afford a $100 purchase?", and generates automated budget recommendations.

Uses quantitative finance techniques to optimize cash flow, budget allocation, and personal financial risk management.

Provides interactive, AI-powered visualizations for real-time insights.

Research & Quantitative Approach:
Algorithmic Finance Optimization:

Implement Reinforcement Learning for spending pattern adaptation.

Use Monte Carlo simulations to predict spending trends.

Develop quantitative risk models for financial health assessment.

Time-Series Forecasting:

Implement LSTM & ARIMA models for future expenditure prediction.

Use volatility estimation models for identifying spending fluctuations.

AI & NLP for Finance Queries:

Train LLMs to process user questions and provide actionable financial insights.

Implement semantic search on Pathway’s vector store to retrieve spending patterns dynamically.

Portfolio & Budget Optimization:

Optimize financial decision-making using Markowitz Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) for personal finance.

Dynamic budget allocation based on Sharpe ratio analysis.

Expected Outcome:
A fully functional AI-driven personal finance platform with:

Real-time transaction processing & AI-powered query handling.

Predictive financial analytics and interactive visualizations.

Automated savings suggestions & financial risk analysis.

Potential applications in Robo-Advisory, AI-driven financial planning, and personalized budgeting tools.
